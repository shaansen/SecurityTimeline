    description:
      "In 1969, ARPANET was first established to enable researchers and educational institutions all over America with the intent of sharing information and making collaboration on projects easy. During its development phase, one of the few peoples to express their concerns on the security aspect of such a network was Willis Ware, an engineer working for RAND Corporation. He explained the risks of resource sharing and online computer networks in his paper 'Security and Privacy in Computer Systems'. At that moment, concerns such as his were disregarded and considered restrictive to the growth of the ARPANET project. (Kaplan, 2016)",
    implication:
      "Ironically, half a century later, all analysis and reports on America's security infrastructure point to the fact that one of the reasons it is vulnerable to cyber attacks is because it was built upon a weak infrastructure. This was something Willis Ware warned people about and wanted people to pay heed to while building the first networks.(Kaplan, 2016)",
