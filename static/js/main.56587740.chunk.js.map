It was recommended that the metadata used for analysis by NSA, be stored outside Fort Meade with the Telecommunication companies. The NSA could access this data only through a court order. The only downside to this recommendation was that now it would take longer for the NSA to access that data than earlier when that data was in-house.\\n2. The second recommendation was that NSA should tighten its security around classified information and create access levels such that system administrators like Snowden could not have access to all those sensitive information.\\n3. Private companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, etc. had either complied with NSA or were asked to by FISA Court order, indicating that the provate firms where aware of their servers being tapped by NSA.\\n\\n4. One of its key findings claimed that there had been no evidence of abuse of data pertaining to American citizens by the NSA. Though, they also mentioned the \"lurking dangers of abuse\" by people having access to this kind of data.\\n\\n5. They also found that inspite of the NSA\\'s bulk metadata collection, the programs did not yield any results in terms of nabbing a single terrorist. But the PRISM Program in specific was able to discover and prevent upto 54 terrorist attacks.
